# Hotel_booking-EDA
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior. By examining factors such as booking frequency, cancellation rates, seasonal trends, and customer demographics, the analysis provides actionable insights to inform business decisions and enhance hotel operations.  


Based on the analysis of the provided graphs, here are tailored recommendations:
Implement a Seasonal Pricing Strategy:

Adjust room rates according to demand fluctuations throughout the year. During peak seasons, increase prices to maximize revenue, and offer competitive rates or promotions during off-peak periods to maintain occupancy.
Investigate and Address Cancellation Causes:

Analyze the primary reasons for reservation cancellations, such as unmet customer requests or misadvertisement, and implement measures to mitigate these issues.
Enhance Customer Communication:

Clearly communicate booking policies, amenities, and any potential restrictions to customers to set accurate expectations and reduce cancellations due to misadvertisement.
Monitor Competitor Pricing:

Regularly assess competitors' pricing strategies, especially during high-demand periods, to ensure your rates remain attractive and competitive.
Leverage Data Analytics:

Utilize data analytics to identify trends in booking patterns, customer preferences, and cancellation reasons, enabling informed decision-making and targeted marketing strategies.
By implementing these strategies, hotels can optimize revenue, reduce cancellation rates, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.![output_24_0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/755b845b-0b40-4f3c-8b18-033c6c020f16)



This bar chart provides an analysis of the reservation status count, specifically comparing the number of canceled and non-canceled reservations. Here's a detailed analysis based on the chart:
Key Observations:

Non-Canceled Reservations:

The number of reservations that were not canceled is significantly higher than the number of canceled reservations.
The count is approximately 70,000 or more.
Canceled Reservations:

The count of canceled reservations is notably lower than non-canceled reservations.
The approximate count is around 40,000.
General Trend:

A substantial proportion of reservations were successfully completed or retained, with cancellations forming a smaller, but still significant, portion.
Implications:

Customer Retention:

The high count of non-canceled reservations indicates strong customer retention or successful booking completion.
Cancellation Rate:

The cancellation count, while smaller, is still notable and could warrant investigation into reasons for cancellations (e.g., pricing, scheduling, external factors).
Operational Insights:

If cancellations are preventable, addressing the causes could improve overall revenue and efficiency.![output_17_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/136c2e6a-eb5c-4578-863d-fbb3b7d56822)
